#Seoul City Guide for Alexa

This is a limited travel guide for English-speaking tourists to Seoul, featuring a top five list as well as six additional Seoul attractions that may be of interest. Names follow local pronunciation more closely so you can better ensure that you get to your destination. You can also get three latest news headlines courtesy of the New York Times. Listen to one of the attractions outside of the top five by saying "get an attraction".

   * “Alexa, ask Seoul Guide more information about Seoul.”
   * “Alexa, ask Seoul Guide what is number four.” (in the top five list)
   * “Alexa, ask Seoul Guide for the local news.”
